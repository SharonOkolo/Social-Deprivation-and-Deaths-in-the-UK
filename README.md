# Social-Deprivation-and-Mortality-in-the-UK
This project explores the relationship between social deprivation, income inequality, and mortality rates across UK cities using a variety of machine learning and statistical approaches.
The dataset includes indicators such as deprivation domains (employment, health, income, education), IMD deciles, population, deaths, mortality rates, and median income.

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and predictive insights that can help understand how socioeconomic inequality affects public health outcomes.

Project Aims & Objectives

Predict Mortality Rates
Build supervised ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict mortality rates per 100k from deprivation and income indicators.

Cluster Cities by Deprivation Profiles
Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering) to group cities with similar social and health patterns.

Forecast Trends Over Time
Use time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) to project future changes in mortality and deprivation levels.

Causal Analysis of Inequality and Health
Estimate the causal impact of income and deprivation on mortality using techniques such as Propensity Score Matching or Causal Forests.

Develop a City Health Risk Index
Create a composite scoring system to rank cities based on multidimensional deprivation and mortality indicators.

Explainable AI for Policy Insight
Use model interpretation tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to identify which deprivation factors most influence health outcomes.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlation heatmaps, domain-level comparison, and geospatial visualization.

Modeling: Supervised (regression/classification), unsupervised (clustering), time-series, and causal inference.

Interpretability: Feature importance, SHAP explanations, and policy-relevant visualization.

Evaluation: RÂ², RMSE, silhouette score, forecasting accuracy depending on task type.

Impact

This project aims to contribute to evidence-based policymaking by highlighting:

The key socioeconomic factors driving mortality disparities.

How deprivation dynamics evolve across time and regions.

Data-driven insights that can guide targeted public health interventions and resource allocation.

Ultimately, it seeks to demonstrate how machine learning can be used for social good, translating data into actionable insights for healthier, more equitable communities.
