# Social-Deprivation-and-Mortality-in-the-UK
This project explores the relationship between social deprivation, income inequality, and mortality rates across UK cities using a variety of machine learning and statistical approaches.
The dataset includes indicators such as deprivation domains (employment, health, income, education), IMD deciles, population, deaths, mortality rates, and median income.

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and predictive insights that can help understand how socioeconomic inequality affects public health outcomes.
